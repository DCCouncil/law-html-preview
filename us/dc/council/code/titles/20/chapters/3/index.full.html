This proceeding is instituted when an interested person or creditor files a petition for a formal probate proceeding with the Court in accordance with the provisions of section 20-304  ; and the filing of a complaint shall not be required for these purposes. This proceeding is conducted after notice as provided in section 20-323  . If no petition for abbreviated or formal probate is filed within a reasonable time, the Register, with the approval of the Court, may file a petition for formal probate.</p>
